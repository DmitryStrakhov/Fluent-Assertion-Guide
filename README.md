# Fluent-Assertion-Guide

I like [Fluent Assertions](https://fluentassertions.com) library very much and use it a lot. My 'Fluent-Assertion-Guide' project was created when I was studying [the library documentation](https://fluentassertions.com/introduction).

I decided to save it here to use as a handbook which demonstrates the library API. It is well structured and helps me to save time when I forgot something and need to remember quickly) Would be happy if it comes helpful for someone else too.
